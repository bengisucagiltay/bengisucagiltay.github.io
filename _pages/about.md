I'm an Assistant Professor of Media and Visual Arts at Koç University, Istanbul. I specialize in interaction design (IxD) and user experience research (UXR) in the context of social robots in everyday life.

I received my Ph.D. in **Computer Sciences** (’25) at the University of Wisconsin–Madison, advised by [Bilge Mutlu](http://bilgemutlu.com), in the [People and Robots Laboratory](https://peopleandrobots.wisc.edu/staff/cagiltay-bengisu/).  
I also hold a Ph.D. minor in [Human Development and Family Studies](https://humanecology.wisc.edu/academics/graduate-programs/human-development-family-studies/), an M.S. in **Cognitive Science** (’20) from [Middle East Technical University](https://cogs.metu.edu.tr/en), and a B.S. in **Computer Science** (’18) from [Bilkent University](https://w3.cs.bilkent.edu.tr).

## 👩🏽‍💻 Research Interests

I develop design principles for **socially interactive systems** (e.g., social robots) and study their **social and practical impact** in everyday contexts. My work takes an **interdisciplinary approach** grounded in computer science, interaction design, cognitive science, and human ecology.  

I apply **qualitative and design-based methods** to understand user needs, generate technical insights, and design, prototype, and deploy socio-technical systems.  
I use **ecological and family theories** to describe how people engage with technology in long-term, real-world settings.

## 🤖 Research Themes and Methods

My research can be understood through three interconnected themes, applied in the context of _social robots for families_ 🤖🏡👪:

<details>
<summary><strong>1) Human-Centered Design of Social Robots</strong></summary>

<p markdown="1">
  I identify users’ practical needs and preferences for integrating socially interactive systems into daily life through <it>participatory design, qualitative interviews, and technology probe studies.</it>
I translate these understandings into design requirements and prototype social robots for real-world use.
  
  **Example Publications:** Designing [in-home robots](https://bengisucagiltay.github.io/publications/IDC20) as [reading companions](https://bengisucagiltay.github.io/publications/IDC22), for [caretaking](https://bengisucagiltay.github.io/publications/IDC22short), and as [homework assistants](https://bengisucagiltay.github.io/publications/IDC23). Designing [unboxing experiences](https://bengisucagiltay.github.io/publications/CHI22) and [emotional expressions](https://bengisucagiltay.github.io/publications/IDC21) for social robots.

<details>
<summary><strong>2) Understanding Real-World Use of Social Robots</strong></summary>

<p markdown="1">
  I study how users interact with social robots in natural, real-world settings and lab contexts through <it>controlled studies, exploratory fieldwork, and both short- and long-term evaluations.</it>  


  **Example Publications:**  [4-week in-home deployment](https://bengisucagiltay.github.io/publications/HRI23) of the [Misty robot platform](https://www.mistyrobotics.com/research) as a [reading companion robot for children](https://bengisucagiltay.github.io/publications/IDC22).
</p>

</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>3) Theory and Methods for Human-Robot Interaction</strong></summary>

<p markdown="1">
  I draw theoretical insights from interdisciplinary fields to situate my research in broader socio-technical systems and develop design methods for holistic human-robot interaction.  


  **Example Publications:**  
  **Theory:** [Family Theories in Human-Robot Interaction](https://bengisucagiltay.github.io/publications/IDC23-short), [Toward Family-Robot Interactions](https://bengisucagiltay.com/publications/HRI24)  
  **Methods and Tools:** [Theater-inspired interaction design](https://bengisucagiltay.com/publications/DIS24), [Family-Robot Routines Inventory](https://bengisucagiltay.com/publications/ROMAN24)
