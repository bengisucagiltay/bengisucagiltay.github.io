I am a PhD candidate at the [People and Robots Laboratory](https://peopleandrobots.wisc.edu/staff/cagiltay-bengisu/) at the Computer Sciences Department of University of Wisconsin-Madison, advised by [Bilge Mutlu](http://bilgemutlu.com). I received my PhD minor in [Human Development and Family Studies](https://humanecology.wisc.edu/academics/graduate-programs/human-development-family-studies/), MS degree in Cognitive Science ('20) from [Middle East Technical University](https://cogs.metu.edu.tr/en) and a BS degree in Computer Science ('18) from [Bilkent University](https://w3.cs.bilkent.edu.tr). I take an interdisciplinary lens in my research, with the intersection of computer science, cognitive science, social robotics, design, and family studies.

**I am on the job market for post-doc and research oriented industry positions! -open to relocate-**

## Research Interests
In my research, I take a family-centered approach to develop design requirements for social companion robots tailored to the needs and preferences of children and families. Through qualitative and design-based research, I study user interactions and explore how these technologies can be used to improve familiesâ€™ lives, facilitate routines, and support connections.

## Research Themes
1) Human-Centered Design of Social Robots (e.g., [in-home robots](https://bengisucagiltay.github.io/publications/IDC20) as [reading companions](https://bengisucagiltay.github.io/publications/IDC22), for [caretaking](https://bengisucagiltay.github.io/publications/IDC22short), as [homework assistants](https://bengisucagiltay.github.io/publications/IDC23) [unboxing experiences](https://bengisucagiltay.github.io/publications/CHI22), [emotion design](https://bengisucagiltay.github.io/publications/IDC21))

2) Understanding Real-World Use of Social Robots:  (e.g., in-home deployment of the [Misty robot platform](https://www.mistyrobotics.com/research) as a reading companion [home deployment](https://bengisucagiltay.github.io/publications/HRI23))

3) Theory and Methods for Human-Robot Interaction (e.g., [Family Theories in Human-Robot Interaction](https://bengisucagiltay.github.io/publications/IDC23-short), [Toward Family-Robot Interactions](https://bengisucagiltay.com/publications/HRI24)), [Theater-inspired interaction design](https://bengisucagiltay.com/publications/DIS24), [Family-Robot Routines Inventory](https://bengisucagiltay.com/publications/ROMAN24)
