I received my Ph.D. (’25) in Computer Sciences at the **University of Wisconsin–Madison**, advised by [Bilge Mutlu](http://bilgemutlu.com), as part of the [People and Robots Laboratory](https://peopleandrobots.wisc.edu/staff/cagiltay-bengisu/).  
I also received a Ph.D. minor in [Human Development and Family Studies](https://humanecology.wisc.edu/academics/graduate-programs/human-development-family-studies/), an M.S. in **Cognitive Science** (’20) from [Middle East Technical University](https://cogs.metu.edu.tr/en), and a B.S. in **Computer Science** (’18) from [Bilkent University](https://w3.cs.bilkent.edu.tr).

## 👩🏽‍💻 Research Interests

My research goal is to develop design principles for **socially interactive systems** and to understand their social, practical, and meaningful impact on people’s and communities’ everyday lives.  

I take an **interdisciplinary approach**, grounded in areas such as computer science, interaction design, cognitive science, and human ecology.  
I apply qualitative and design-based methods to understand user needs, develop technical insights, and design, prototype, and deploy socio-technical systems.  
I use ecological theories to describe phenomena observed in long-term, real-world deployments.

## 🤖 Research Themes

Three complementary themes describe my research, applied in the context of _social robots for families_ 👪🏡🤖:

<details>
<summary><strong>1) Human-Centered Design of Social Robots</strong></summary>

- I identify the practical needs and preferences of users for integrating socially interactive systems into daily life, through methods such as participatory design, qualitative interviews, or technology probe studies in real-world settings.  
  I translate these understandings into technical insights that guide design requirements, and I conduct iterative design and development processes to prototype social robots for real-world use.

- **Examples:**  
  Designing [in-home robots](https://bengisucagiltay.github.io/publications/IDC20) as [reading companions](https://bengisucagiltay.github.io/publications/IDC22), for [caretaking](https://bengisucagiltay.github.io/publications/IDC22short), and as [homework assistants](https://bengisucagiltay.github.io/publications/IDC23).  
  Designing [unboxing experiences](https://bengisucagiltay.github.io/publications/CHI22) and [emotional expressions](https://bengisucagiltay.github.io/publications/IDC21) for social robots.

</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>2) Understanding Real-World Use of Social Robots</strong></summary>

- I study how users interact with social robots in natural, real-world settings or lab contexts — through controlled user studies, exploratory field studies, and both short- and long-term evaluations.

- **Examples:**  
  [4-week in-home deployment](https://bengisucagiltay.github.io/publications/HRI23) of the [Misty robot platform](https://www.mistyrobotics.com/research) as a [reading companion robot for children](https://bengisucagiltay.github.io/publications/IDC22).

</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>3) Theory and Methods for Human-Robot Interaction</strong></summary>

- I draw theoretical insights from interdisciplinary fields to situate my research in broader socio-technical systems.  
  I develop design methods that capture a holistic lens in human-robot interaction.

- **Examples:**  
  **Theory:** [Family Theories in Human-Robot Interaction](https://bengisucagiltay.github.io/publications/IDC23-short), [Toward Family-Robot Interactions](https://bengisucagiltay.com/publications/HRI24)  
  **Methods and Tools:** [Theater-inspired interaction design](https://bengisucagiltay.com/publications/DIS24), [Family-Robot Routines Inventory](https://bengisucagiltay.com/publications/ROMAN24)
