I am a PhD candidate at the [People and Robots Laboratory](https://peopleandrobots.wisc.edu/staff/cagiltay-bengisu/) at the Computer Sciences Department of University of Wisconsin-Madison, advised by [Bilge Mutlu](http://bilgemutlu.com). I received my PhD minor in [Human Development and Family Studies](https://humanecology.wisc.edu/academics/graduate-programs/human-development-family-studies/), MS degree in Cognitive Science ('20) from [Middle East Technical University](https://cogs.metu.edu.tr/en) and a BS degree in Computer Science ('18) from [Bilkent University](https://w3.cs.bilkent.edu.tr).

## Research Interests
My research goal is to develop design principles for socially interactive systems and to understand the social, practical, and meaningful impact of these systems in people’s and communities’ everyday lives.

I take an interdisciplinary approach in my research, grounded in areas such as computer science, interaction design, cognitive science, and human ecology. I apply qualitative and design-based research methods to understand user needs and develop technical insights to design, prototype, and deploy socio-technical systems. I use ecological theories to describe observed phenomena within long-term and real-world deployments.

## Research Themes
My research is categorized in three complementary themes that contribute to our understanding and design of socio-technical systems, applied in the context of social robots for families:

1) **Human-Centered Design of Social Robots:**
I identify the practical needs and preferences of users for integrating socially interactive systems into daily life, through methods such as participatory design, qualitative interviews, or technology probe studies in real-world settings. I translate these understandings into technical insights that guide design requirements and I conduct iterative design and development processes to prototype social robots for families.

Examples | Designing [in-home robots](https://bengisucagiltay.github.io/publications/IDC20) as [reading companions](https://bengisucagiltay.github.io/publications/IDC22), for [caretaking](https://bengisucagiltay.github.io/publications/IDC22short), as [homework assistants](https://bengisucagiltay.github.io/publications/IDC23)) | (Designing [unboxing experiences](https://bengisucagiltay.github.io/publications/CHI22) and [emotional expressions](https://bengisucagiltay.github.io/publications/IDC21) for social robots)|

2) **Understanding Real-World Use of Social Robots:**
I study how children and families interact with social robots in natural real-world settings or in research lab contexts; through controlled user studies or exploratory field studies; and over short-term or long-term evaluations.

Examples | in-home deployment of the [Misty robot platform](https://www.mistyrobotics.com/research) as a reading companion [home deployment](https://bengisucagiltay.github.io/publications/HRI23))|

3) **Theory and Methods for Human-Robot Interaction:** I draw theoretical insights from interdisciplinary fields to situate my research in the broader socio-technical systems. I develop design methods to capture a holistic lens in human-robot interaction.

Examples | Theory: [Family Theories in Human-Robot Interaction](https://bengisucagiltay.github.io/publications/IDC23-short), [Toward Family-Robot Interactions](https://bengisucagiltay.com/publications/HRI24)) | (Methods and Tools: [Theater-inspired interaction design](https://bengisucagiltay.com/publications/DIS24), [Family-Robot Routines Inventory](https://bengisucagiltay.com/publications/ROMAN24))|
